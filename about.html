                    This website was made to provide a break even calculator for buying and selling stocks and/or ETFs on Questrade. Currently
                    the website supports only basic buy and sell transactions. The break even price is calculated using the cost information found on
                    Questrade's <a href="https://www.questrade.com/pricing/self-directed-commissions-plans-fees/transaction">website</a>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In order to find the break even price for a position, the calculator will determine the total cost of conducting a buy AND sell
                    transaction.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Transactions may incur an exchange, or ECN fee. This depends on what type of buy or sell order is being done or considered. When the order
                    is a market order, than ECN fees will occur. If it is a limit order, than no fees occur unless the limit order is a marketable limit order.
                    However, if the quantity of the order is not a multiple of 100, than ECN fees will occur regardless. ECN fees vary depending on the exchange
                    and routes used for the transaction.

                <p>
                    Commissions are charged for each transaction whenever a stock is being bought and sold. For ETFs, commission is only charged on the sale.
                    Commissions are decided based on the quantity, with a minimum commission of $4.95, maximum of $9.95. Quantities between 495 and 995 are charged
                    $0.01 per share. Quantites lower are charged $4.95, and quantities higher are charged $9.95.
